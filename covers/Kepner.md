Graphs are among the most important abstract data structures in computer science, and the algorithms that operate on them are critical to modern life. Graphs have been shown to be powerful tools for modeling complex problems because of their simplicity and generality. For this reason, the field of graph algorithms has become one of the pillars of theoretical computer science, informing research in such diverse areas as combinatorial optimization, complexity theory, and topology. Graph algorithms have been adapted and implemented by the military and commercial industry, as well as by researchers in academia, and have become essential in controlling the power grid, telephone systems, and, of course, computer networks.

In this monograph, we address these challenges by exploiting the well-known duality between the canonical representation of graphs as abstract collections of vertices with edges and a sparse adjacency matrix representation. In so doing, we show how to leverage existing parallel matrix computation techniques as well as the large amount of software infrastructure that exists for these computations to implement efficient and scalable parallel graph algorithms. In addition, and perhaps more importantly, a linear algebraic approach allows the large pool of researchers trained in fields other than computer science, but who have a strong linear algebra background, to quickly understand and apply graph algorithms.
