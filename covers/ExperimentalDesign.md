An essential textbook for any student or researcher in biology needing to design experiments, sampling programs or analyze the resulting data. The text begins with a revision of estimation and hypothesis testing methods, covering both classical and Bayesian philosophies, before advancing to the analysis of linear and generalized linear models. Topics covered include linear and logistic regression, simple and complex ANOVA models (for factorial, nested, block, split-plot and repeated measures and covariance designs), and log-linear models. Multivariate techniques, including classification and ordination, are then introduced. Special emphasis is placed on checking assumptions, exploratory data analysis and presentation of results. The main analyses are illustrated with many examples from published papers and there is an extensive reference list to both the statistical and biological literature. The book is sup- ported by a website that provides all data sets, questions for each chapter and links to software.

**Gerry Quinn** is in the School of Biological Sciences at Monash University, with research interests in marine and freshwater ecology, especially river floodplains and their associated wetlands.

**Michael Keough** is in the Department of Zoology at the University of Melbourne, with research interests in marine ecology, environmental science and conservation biology.

Both authors have extensive experience teaching experimental design and analysis courses and have provided advice on the design and analysis of sampling and experimental programs in ecology and environmental monitoring to a wide range of environmental consultants, university and government scientists.
