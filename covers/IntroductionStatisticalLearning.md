Statistical learning refers to a set of tools for _making sense of complex datasets_. In recent years, we have seen a staggering increase in the scale and scope of data collection across virtually all areas of science and industry. As a result, statistical learning has become a critical toolkit for anyone who wishes to understand data — and as more and more of today’s jobs involve data, this means that statistical learning is fast becoming a critical toolkit for _everyone_.

_An Introduction to Statistical Learning_ (ISL) arose from the clear need for a broader and less technical treatment of the key topics in statistical learning. The intention behind ISL is to concentrate more on the applications of the methods and less on the mathematical details. Beginning with Chapter 2, each chapter in ISL contains a lab illustrating how to implement the statistical learning methods seen in that chapter using the popular statistical software package `R`. These labs provide the reader with valuable hands-on experience.
